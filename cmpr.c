We record the request and response so we can calculate the cost.

For now we have the following costs for gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 as the model:

gpt-3.5-turbo-0125  $0.50 / 1M tokens $1.50 / 1M tokens

This means for 19 tokens we must multiply by $0.5 then 10e-6.
For 9 completion tokens we multiply by $1.5 then 10e-6.
So we spent 14 millionths of a dollar on output and 10 millionths on input.

- buildcmd, the command to do a build (e.g. by the "B" key)
- bootstrap, a command that creates an initial prompt (see README)
- cbcopy, the command to pipe data to the clipboard on the user's platform
- cbpaste, the same but for getting data from the clipboard
- curlbin, the path to curl (or just "curl" if unspecified)
- model, the LLM currently in use, one of "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4-turbo", "clipboard"

We define a struct, ui_state, which we can use to store any information about the UI that we can then pass around to various functions as a single entity.
This includes, so far:

- files, a projfiles array of files in the project
- current language, a span, used by the file/language config handler functions
- the blocks, a spans
- the current_index, the number of blocks prior to the selected one (i.e. zero-indexed)
- the current_file, the number of files prior to the selected one
- a marked_index, which represent the "other end" of a selected range
- the search span which will contain "/" followed by some search if in search mode, otherwise will be empty()
- the previous search span, used for n/N
- the ex_command which similarly contains ":" if in ex command entry mode, otherwise empty()
- the config file path as a span
- terminal_rows and _cols which stores the terminal dimensions
- scrolled_lines, the number of physical lines that have been scrolled off the screen upwards
- openai_key, an OpenAI API key, or an empty span
- bootstrapprompt, either empty or contains the bootstrap prompt

Additionally, we include a span for each of the config files, with an X macro inside the struct, using CONFIG_FIELDS defined above.

/* #main

In main,

First we call init_spans, since all our i/o relies on it.

We call projfiles_arena_alloc near the top and and _free before we exit, with room for 1 << 14 (2^14) elements.

We similarly call span_arena_alloc() and span_arena_free() at the end just for clarity even though it doesn't matter anyway since we're exiting the process.
We allocate a spans arena of 1 << 20, a binary million spans.

Above (in #ui_state), we have declared a global ui_state* called state, which allows us to not pass around the ui_state singleton all over our program.
After declaring our ui_state variable in main, which we call stack_state since it's nominally on the stack, being declared in main, and which we initialize to {0}, we then set this global pointer to its address.

We set config_file_path on the state to the default configuration file path which is ".cmpr/conf", i.e. always relative to the CWD.
This is important because in handle_args we will already want to either print the args in the default file, or otherwise in a non-standard file location, so this is really where we set the default configuration.

We projfiles_alloc room for 1024 files on the state, and set the ".n" to zero, so we can use the _push() pattern.
(Discursion:
The alloc pattern normally returns a full array with n already set to the required size, and it is usually filled in a loop.
This may turn out to be a design mistake but we're sticking with it for now.
Anyway, this is why we have to set .n to 0 here.)

We call a function handle_args to handle argc and argv.
This function will also read our config file (if any).
We call check_conf_vars() once after this; we will also call it in the main loop but we need it before trying to get the code.

We call check_dirs() which creates any missing directories.

Next we call a function get_code().
This function either handles reading standard input or it reads the files indicated by our config file.
In either case, once this returns, inp is populated and any other initial code indexing work is done.

Next we call get_revs(), which handles reading and indexing all of our revisions (in <cmprdir>/revs).

We call bootstrap(), which updates the bootstrap prompt.

Then we call main_loop().

The main loop reads input in a loop and probably won't return, but just in case, we always call flush() before we return so that our buffered output from prt and friends will be flushed to stdout.

This also just gets us into the habit of calling flush() everywhere, which is pretty much necessary since we always care about precisely when our output becomes visible.

In this function, we check that the file ~/.cmpr/openai-key exists and has the correct permissions.

Specifically, it should have read permissions only for the owner, which must be the current user.

We use null-terminated strings and standard C library functions for all of this.

We then extend cmp.end to fit the file contents, and read the file contents into that space.

We set state.openai_key to point to the file contents.

However, we actually want to trim whitespace (such as a newline that must end the file) in case we print the key as a string (such as in an HTTP header), so we call trim() on it.

If any of the steps fail, we return and do nothing.
This will leave openai_key empty, indicating that the API is not available.

Here we talk to an OpenAI model via the API.

We are given a json (the type) which contains an array of messages, and a span which contains a model string, and return network_ret.

Next we set up a json object.
We use prt2cmp() so that the json object will be written to cmp space.
Using the json api functions, we make a json object and extend it with "messages" as the messages and with "model" as json_s of the model string, then go back to normal with prt2std().

We will write the request body and response or error to disk, so first we set up three filenames.
The filename is <cmprdir>/api_calls/<timestamp>-{req,resp,err} where cmprdir comes from state and the timestamp is in the format YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.
The three filenames (-req, -resp, and -err) all have the same timestamp, which lets us correlate them later.
To construct them we set up a base filename first and then append the req, resp, err to it in turn.

We write the request body to disk, without clobbering as it should not exist, then we call call_gpt_curl to handle the HTTP request, passing in the three filename spans, and we return what it returns.

/* #call_gpt_curl

This is the network part of call_gpt().

We get three filenames, req, resp, and err, respectively, and we return a network_ret.

The HTTP request body as a JSON object has already been written into the req file.

We handle the communication by calling curl.
We put the binary name in a span, either state->curlbin, or just "curl" if that is empty.

Next we construct a curl command.

We need to tell curl:
- to be silent except in case of error with -sS,
- the name of the file with the JSON payload,
- to set the content-type header,
- to use the API key (Bearer token) which is in state->openai_key, something like "Authorization: Bearer <key>",
- to put the output into the resp file,
- the API endpoint,
- and finally to redirect stderr to the err file.

We put the command together with snprintf.
As always, to print any span x we use `%.*s`, with corresponding arguments len(x) and x.buf.

Don't forget to quote HTTP headers when composing the curl command with -H to protect them from being split by the shell.

Our return value is a network_ret, declared above, which either has success = 1 and the .response contains the body of the API response or success = 0 and .error contains a human-readable error message.

If the openai_key is empty, we report this on .error and return a network_ret with success = 0.

We read the contents of the resp file with read_file_into_cmp and set this on .response.
If the curl command returned non-zero, we also read the contents of the err file into .err.
We always read the resp file, even in cases of error.

Wrapped with prt2cmp() and prt2std(), we make a json object and extend it with "messages" as the messages and with "model" as json_s of the model string.

Then we call call_gpt_network to handle the HTTP request.

We write the request body and the response or error to disk using write_to_file_span, without clobbering since the files should not already exist.
The filename is <cmprdir>/api_calls/<timestamp>{-req,-resp,-err} where cmprdir comes from state and the timestamp is in the format YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.

Note: recall the %.*s pattern when printing spans with prt.

/* (historical) call_gpt_network

Historical libcurl-based implementation.

This is the network part of call_gpt().

We get a json containing the API request POST data (in the inner span .s) and return a successful API response or some error message.

We handle the communication with libcurl, using CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE to explicitly set the length of the data we are sending and CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS just gets the span .buf directly (not a null-terminated string).

Our return value is a network_ret, declared above, which either has success = 1 and the response contains the body of the API response or success = 0 and .error contains a human-readable error message.

(Note that curl_easy_strerror returns a const char* so we have to cast to char* before calling S().)

To collect the response we use a write_callback which passes a span around as the user data.
We read the API response into cmp space, so this span starts out as an empty span at cmp.end.
When extending it we check that it does not go past cmp_space + BUF_SZ (and complain and exit if that happens).

API endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

The API key (Bearer token) is in state->openai_key, use something like:
    char auth_header[256];
    sprintf(auth_header, "Authorization: Bearer %.*s", len(state->openai_key), state->openai_key.buf);

// historical implementation:

size_t write_callback(char *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata) {
    size_t total_size = size * nmemb;
    span *s = (span *)userdata;

  Print usage summary, help on command-line flags and exit.

init:
  Initialize .cmpr/ in the current directory.

version:
  Print the version number and build timestamp and exit.

print-{block,comment,code}:
  Print the revelant part (or whole) of the block given by the one-based index.

checkout:
  Get a current copy of a git repo (or other inferred repo type) in the most reasonable way possible, failing if it is not well-known; for example, cmpr --checkout jquery would succeed while xyzzy should not as it is not unambiguously pointing to a single project; if you want this to be consistent, you should include a year tag as a modifier of the project name.

3. Implementation notes:

conf:
  update config_file_path on the state; we must do this before calling parse_config

print-conf:
  we print the configuration (print_config()) and exit; we must have called parse_config (and set an alt conf file if any) prior

help:
  we just prt a short usage summary, flush(), and exit(0)
  we define a macro flush_exit(n) to reduce typing
  we include argv[0] as usual and summarize everything we support.

init:
  we just call cmpr_init; we can't combine this with --conf, because --init creates the configuration file and we don't want to create configuration files in random places (the user can still move the file themselves and use --conf later if they are doing something exotic)

version:
  we prt "Version: $VERSION$" here; the dollar-delimited variable-looking thing is replaced by a build step

--help, --init, --version:
  these three flags all are "action args"; if one is provided, any other flags will have no effect
  if more than one is given, any one of them may take effect (we don't care which), but not more than one

print-{code,comment,block}, count-blocks, find-block:
  all of these require the code be loaded, which normally happens after we are called
  so if any of these flags are used we call get_code() first, then we call the appropriate function, then flush and exit successfully
  we always use one-based indexes for anything user-visible, so we must add or subtract one when calling our functions (find_block, print_block, print_comment, print_code)

checkout:
  we haven't implemented this feature yet, but the idea is that we will call a service on our name resolver; our service will return the jquery location on github which it has previously learned from chatgpt, and it will return a new one after a delay if it has never been cached on the server before; if we can't be sure about it, or we don't understand the license as clearly allowing us to host it, then we skip it

4. Help strings:

conf:
  Use alternate configuration file <filepath>.

print-conf:
  Print the current configuration settings.

init:
  Initialize a new directory for use with cmpr.

help:
  Display this help message.

version:
  Display the version number / build string.

print-block, -comment, -code:
  Print a complete block (or comment or code part) given by index.

find-block:
  Print index of first block matching search string by full-text search, or -1.

count-blocks:
  Print number of blocks in project.

--- end argtable

Below we implement void handle_args(int argc, char **argv);

Here are some random further implementation notes on that:

There are things that have to be handled in specific orderings.
Our basic technique here is to set indicators (0- or 1-valued ints) in our arg-handling loop.
These are used directly in if statements, like `if (ind_print_block) { ...`.
Below the loop we then handle the necessaries in the correct order.
We use "int ind_*" for these variables so they don't conflict with functions or anything else we already have.
We also have an int "action_arg" which tracks whether one of the action flags has been set, char pointers for string arguments like conf filepath or find-block search, and a block index which is shared by print-{block,comment,code}.

None of these flags can be combined: print-block, print-comment, print-code, find-block, count-blocks.
If more than one is set, we print an error message and exit.
If any of these are set then we exit successfully, but if none of them is, then we will return from this function and enter our main loop.

Because --init is used to set up the config file, it cannot be combined with --conf, if it is, we also print an error and exit.
Also, if we are doing an --init, we need to not try to parse the config file, because that will definitely fail.

If "--conf <alternate-config-file>" is passed, we update config_file_path on the state.
Once we know the conf file to read from, we call parse_config before we do anything else.

If "--print-conf" is passed in, we print our configuration settings and exit.
This is only OK to do once we have already called parse_config, so the configuration settings have already been read in from the file.

This function will always call parse_config, always before printing the config if "--print-conf" is used, and always after updating the config file if "--conf" is used.
In particular, even if no alternate conf file was set, we still need to read the default conf file.

How we handle files and blocks:

- Non-empty files are tiled by blocks and the block location unambiguously identifies the file it is part of.
- Empty files contain no blocks.

We will have a file called catalog in the revdir.
Each rev will get a line in this file.

The fields can be separated by spaces

50000 LOC * 16 bytes per hash = ~1MB of line hashes

We can just hash short inputs to themselves, but anything 16 bytes or longer we will hash to an ASCII hex representation of the siphash.

This avoids the possibility of collisions between a string and its literal hash (even though this is already unlikely, like 1/2^64 unlikely).

We have an average line length of 39 bytes in our code to date, so we would expand the data by roughly 50% by hashing every line.

In find_blocks_language_python, we get a span containing a file.

We write two loops.
In the first one we count the blocks, then we spans_alloc our return value with the correct number, and in the second loop we assign the spans.

For a Python file, a block starts with triple double-quote at the beginning of a line.
It contains another triple double-quote at the beginning of a line somewhere in the middle of the block, ending the comment part, which we must skip over.
It ends where the next block starts (true for all blocks regardless of language).

There are some special cases:

If the file is empty, we return a single empty block.

If a file does not begin with the triple quote, then the first block will just be from the beginning of the file to the second triple quote at the beginning of a line.

The last block always goes to the end of the file.

Before the first loop we copy our argument into a new span `copy` so that we can consume it while counting, but then still have access to the original full span for the second loop.

The block-finding loop:
- While the remaining input is not empty, we get the next line. (Note that next_line will return everything left if there is no newline).
- If this line starts with the pattern, or if it is the first line in the file, then it begins a block (regardless of whether the line is empty), otherwise we simply do nothing and continue the loop. (If it starts with the pattern and we have seen an odd number of them so far, then we skip it because the pattern appears two times in each Python block.)
- If we are counting blocks, we increment our counter, otherwise we assign .buf of a span for this block, and if we had a previous block, we assign .end of that block to the same offset.
- When we reach the end of the input we will assign .end of the last block to the end of the input.

(To determine if we are at the start of the input, we can compare .buf of the line with that of the input.)

At the end of the function, we ensure with a simple loop, that all the blocks returned together tile the file, and that none are empty.
This means:
The first block begins where our input span begins.
The last block ends where our input ends.
If either of these conditions fails, the sanity test fails.
For every other block, .buf is equal to the .end of the previous.
If this sanity check fails, we complain and crash as usual (prt, flush, exit).

In find_blocks_language_c, we get a span containing a file.

We write two loops.
In the first one we count the blocks, then we spans_alloc our return value with the correct number, and in the second loop we assign the spans.

For a C file, a block starts with the slash-star pattern at the beginning of a line.
It ends where the next block starts.

There are some special cases:

If the file is empty, we return a single empty block.
We handle this as a special case, since it doesn't really work with our two-loop approach.
We also care about where the blocks are, even if they are empty, so in this case we ensure that the empty block we return is the same as the empty span of the file itself (i.e. .buf and .end are equal to each other, and to those of the file: we can NOT use nullspan() here).

If a file does not begin with a block comment, then the first block will just be from the beginning of the file to the first block comment.

The last block always goes to the end of the file.

Before the first loop we copy our argument into a new span `copy` so that we can consume it while counting, but then still have access to the original full span for the second loop.

The block-finding loop:
- While the remaining input is not empty, we get the next line. (Note that next_line will return everything left if there is no newline).
- If this line starts with the pattern, or if it is the first line in the file, then it begins a block (regardless of whether the line is empty), otherwise we simply do nothing and continue the loop.
- If we are counting blocks, we increment our counter, otherwise we assign .buf of a span for this block, and if we had a previous block, we assign .end of that block to the same offset.
- When we reach the end of the input we will assign .end of the last block to the end of the input.

/* span count_physical_lines(span, int*)

In this function we are given a span and a (pointer to a) maximum number of physical lines to print or count.

The span may be of arbitrary length, which is why we do not simply count the lines in the span; we do not want unbounded runtime.

Definitions:
A logical line is an actual line terminated by newline or by the end of the span.
A physical line is a row of terminal output, which is reached either when terminal_cols characters of output reaches the end of the line, causing wrapping, or when a literal newline is printed (or both).
The physical line is defined such that after printing a physical line (starting at the beginning of a terminal row), the next character printed to the terminal will appear on the subsequent terminal row.

We begin counting physical lines off of the input span according to this definition.
Specifically, we count off either terminal_cols chars, followed by a newline (which will have no effect if it comes after exactly that many chars, i.e. after counting off terminal_cols chars, we need to check if the *next* char is a newline, because if it is we should skip over it), or we count off a shorter line followed by an actual newline.

We decrement the int of remaining lines each time we have counted off a physical line.
Our return value is the span of physical lines that we have counted off.
The int will go to zero if the span passed in is long enough, otherwise the span returned will contain the entire input and the int may remain positive.

(The intended typical use of this function is to provide a span and a desired number of physical lines of terminal space to occupy, then to print the returned span, and perhaps to prepare a suffix of the original span to keep printing, and perhaps to use the int to track remaining lines of terminal output to fill or similar.)

(Note: I don't think the below is correct when a logical line has exactly terminal_cols chars in it, however I don't want to iterate further or test right now.)

/* page_down() and page_up()

Here we implement dual functions that handle pagination within the current block.

We define content_rows as the number of terminal_rows minus two, since we always have a header line and a ruler line reserved at the top and bottom of the screen resp.

We simply increment or decrement state->scrolled_lines by content_rows, except that we always want to fill the screen.
For example, if a block has 23 physical lines and the terminal has 24 rows, then our content area is 22 rows, and when we paginate downwards we will show the last 22 lines of content (skipping only the first line).
Redrawing is handled in the main loop, so all we do here is update scrolled_lines as needed, returning void.

If we are already scrolled to the bottom, scrolling down will have no effect (similarly if scrolled_lines = 0 for scrolling up).

We have a helper function (count_physical_lines) that counts physical lines up to a maximum.
It updates the int passed to it by reference to indicate the remaining number of lines (<= the maximum before the call) that have not been printed (will only be non-zero if the block was short of content).
In page_down, we first call this with scrolled_lines and get a span back which is the part that is already "scrolled off" the top of the screen as the return value.

We make a copy of the block (blocks indexed by current_block, both on state).
We update .buf of this copy to the .end of the scrolled-off part, thus getting the part of the block currently visible on the screen as well as anything "below" the screen.

We then call the helper function again on this remainder content with terminal_rows as the number, to get the number of lines occupied by the currently displayed content, up to a full screen's worth.
If there is less than one full screen's worth currently displayed, then we reduce scrolled_lines by the remaining number, so that the screen becomes full.

(Note that as count_physical_lines decrements the remaining physical lines to print while it is counting off lines, we need to subtract to get the actual number of physical lines of content that would be printed.)

Otherwise, we increase scrolled_lines by a full screenfull, and then we call the helper function a third time.
Now, again, we can check if it will print a full screenfull, and if not, we can again reduce scrolled_lines such that the result will be a full screen of content ending with the last physical line of the block.

The page_up function is a bit simpler, as we can always unconditionally scroll up by a full page of lines, so we simply decrease scrolled_lines by a screenful (with a minimum of zero, obviously).

More specifically, we calculate a mapping from logical lines to physical lines.
First we identify the logical lines by finding the newlines in the block, and we store the offset of each (as an offset from .buf on the block).
We find out how many "physical" lines (i.e. terminal rows) each logical line uses by taking the ceil of quotient of line length by terminal cols.

Then we decide, based on the number of blocks, the layout information, and the terminal dimensions, how many lines from each we can fit on the screen.
For this we declare a separate helper function which we will write later.
We call this function (with the ui state and our logical-physical mapping) and then we free our own resources.

/* #start_search

To support search mode, we have a static buffer of length 256 which can be used to search and which the user types into when in search mode.

In start_search(), to indicate that we are in search mode, we set the search on the ui state to be equal to a span which points at this static buffer.
And we set the span to contain the slash "/" that was typed.
We can do this using S(), but we prefer to just directly construct the span.
When we first go into search mode, we point the span at the start of the static buffer, we make it length 1 and the static buffer always starts with slash.

Then we enter our own loop where we call getch and handle basic line editing.
On any backspace character we will simply shorten the span (.end--) and on any other input at all we will extend it.
However, if we've deleted the initial slash, that means the user doesn't want to be in search mode any more.
Therefore, if the search span on the ui state has zero length, this means search mode is off.
So after every backspace, if the search span length goes to zero then we call print_current_blocks() to update the display and then return.

Every time the contents of the line changes, or when we first enter search mode, we will call another function, perform_search.
This will implement search and also displays the search results and indicates that we're in search mode to the user.
If we hit enter, we call another helper to finish the search successfully.

helper functions:

- perform_search()
- finalize_search()

OF COURSE, we use getch() which we carefully defined above, NEVER getchar().

We write declarations for the helper functions (which we define below).

/* #start_ex

To support ex commands, we have a static buffer (declared in start_ex() below) of length 256 which is used to hold the ex command while the user is typing it.
The first byte of this buffer is always ":".

In start_ex, to indicate that we are going into ex mode, we set ex_command on the state to a span that points at this static buffer, and includes only the ":", since this is what was just typed to get into ex command mode.
We can do this using S(), but we prefer to just directly construct the span.
Then we print the line at the bottom starting with ":" (which is currently the only thing on it) as described below, to indicate to the user that we're now in ex command entry mode.

However, if we've deleted the initial colon, that means the user doesn't want to be in ex command mode any more.
If the state element is empty it always means we are not in the mode.
If this happens we call print_current_blocks() to refresh the display, and then return.

As with search mode, we implement our own input handling with a getch() loop, handling both kinds of backspace, and if enter is hit, we will call handle_ex_command().
On any backspace character we will simply shorten the span (.end--) and on any other input at all we will extend it.
In particular, we want to transparently support UTF-8 input, so if the byte is not a backspace byte we simply append it without any further testing.

In our loop, unlike with search mode, we are not continuously changing what's displayed on the main area of the screen while the user is typing, so we can print an ANSI escape code to move to and clear the last row of the screen and then write our ex_command buffer on this last terminal row (including the ":").
(Obviously, we use prt() just like everywhere else in this codebase, not randomly printf for no reason.)

/* #perform_search

In perform_search(), we update the display after the search string has been updated.

The search string (span state.search) will always start with a slash.
We remove this (there is no library method for this so just directly construct the span) and take the rest of it as the actual string to search for.
We iterate through the blocks and use spanspan to find the first block that matches, along with the number of other blocks that match.
If the search span is empty (as when only "/" was typed) then we match every block, so we can use empty() on the result of spanspan to detect a match, but we also match if the search span is empty().
(This will store the empty span at the beginning of the first block as the match span, which gives the behavior we want when printing the match later.)
We store both the index of the first block that matched and a copy of the span given by spanspan for this first block only, as we will need both of them later.

This tells us where the first block was that matched, and how many total blocks matched, and also the location in the span that contains the match.

Once we have our search results, we call clear_display().

Also at the top, we declare a local variable of remaining lines from the top of the terminal window, since we want to print something at the bottom later.
Every time we print a line or multiple lines, we decrement this value with the number of lines we printed, no more and no less.
In particular, we never decrement this "in advance," for lines to printed later, as that would violate the invariant that the number of actual remaining lines is the number in our variable.

Next, we print "Block N:" on a line (adding one as usual).
Then we decide how many initial lines of the block to print.
Without changing the terminal lines remaining value (since we indeed want our last line to be on the last line) we subtract 8 from this remaining number (leaving space for other output) and divide this by two to get the number of initial block physical lines to print.
Then we print this many physical lines of the block, by calling a function print_physical_lines(span,int).
(Note: physical lines means terminal rows used, as opposed to logical lines actually ending in newline.)

If nothing matched, then we do not print this part, but we still print the "N blocks matched" part later (0 in that case, of course) and the search string itself on the last line.

After the first lines of the block, we print a blank line, then "Match:" on a line, and then the line that contains the matched span.
We call a helper function, print_matching_physical_lines, which takes the block and the actual matched span (which we have from before), and handles finding and printing the match, and returns the number of physical lines that it used.

We print another blank line and then "N blocks matched".

Finally, we will add empty lines until we are at the bottom of the screen as indicated by terminal_rows on the state.
On the last line we will print the entire search string (including the slash).
(We can do this with wrs(), we don't need to add a newline as we are already on the last line of the window anyway.)
Before returning from the function we call flush() as we are responsible for updating the display.

/* Settings.

When the tool starts, we ask about specific configuration settings that must exist.
Otherwise, for settings like the buildcmd we only ask the first time the feature is used.

As settings are changed, we write a configuration file, which is always .cmpr/conf in the current working directory.

The contents of this file will be similar to RFC822-style headers.
We will have a key name followed by colon, space and then a value to the end of the line.

We have functions to read and write this format, which we do in the cmp space.

In handle_conf_{language,file} we are called with a span in each case containing either a pathname or a language, in the order that these config keys occur in the config file.

The idea is that when a language key occurs, it sets the language which is then used on subsequent files.
However, as the one exception to this pattern, when files are included before any language is given, then we will add the files without a language.

Therefore:

- when we see a language line, we will set the current_language on the state
- when we see a file line, we set the language on the file to current_language and add the file to the state
- only in the case where we see a language line and the language was not already set, then we know that this is the first language line in the file; in this case we iterate over any files that we already added, and set the language on them.

Below we write both functions handle_conf_{language,file}.

/*
In the first function, parse_config, we read the contents of our config file (at state->config_file_path) into the cmp space, parse it, and set on the ui_state all the appropriate values.

We have a library method cmp_compl() which gives us the complement of cmp in cmp_space, which is the space that we can safely read into.
We'll read our configuration file into that space with read_file_S_into_span().

After we read the file into cmp, we get a span back from our library method containing the file contents.
We still have to manually update cmp.end to match the end of this span so that later uses of the cmp space don't clobber our configs.

We then can use next_line() in a loop to process them one by one.
First we look for ":" with find_char, and if it is not found, we skip the line.
After the colon we'll skip any whitespace with an isspace() loop and then consider the rest of the line to be the value.
(Note that we don't trim whitespace off the end, something maybe worth documenting elsewhere for config file users).
Next_line has already stripped the newline from the end so we don't need to do that.

Next, we compare the key part before the colon with our list of configuration values above, and if it matches any of them, we set the corresponding member of the ui state, which is always named the same as the config key name.
The values of the config keys will always be spans.
We have CONFIG_FIELDS defined above, we use that here with an X macro.

However, there is an exception to the handling of config fields for some values that might be handled specially.
These are not included in our CONFIG_FIELDS, but instead we handle them with custom code here.
These are:

- language
- file

These are handled by custom code, so we have functions handle_conf_{language,file} (already written above) that we call with the value span for either of these each time they occur in the config file.

/* save_conf_files()

Here we write the language and file lines into the conf file.

The structure of this data in the conf file is that a language line should be included every time the language of the next file is different from the previous file.
For example, if there are three files, with languages C, Python, Python, then we would have a language line of C, then the first file, then language Python and both the other files.

Therefore, we maintain a local variable indicating the last-written language, initially empty of course.
For each file, if the language is already equal to this, then we just print the file line, otherwise we print a language line first.
When printing a language line, we put a blank line first, since these usually group related files together.

As mentioned elsewhere, each conf line includes the key, a colon, space and the value, followed by newline.

First we store a span that has .buf pointing to the current cmp.end.
Then we call prt2cmp() and use prt to print a line for each config var as described below.

/* #check_conf_vars

In check_conf_vars() we test the state for all essential configuration variables and if any is missing we prompt the user to set that.

The essential configuration variables, along with the reason why each is required, are:

cmprdir: Where cmpr will store it's internal state (analogous to .git), recommended: ".cmpr".

TODO: probably all the above "config-related metadata" should be in one place in a table for all the conf vars; we'll do that later.
For now, a local macro cleans up this code quite a bit.

For each missing variable in the order given, we print the string after the colon above as a prompt to the user (and include the configuration parameter name).
(We end the prompt with colon and newline, so the read_line shows up under it.)

We then call read_line to get the new value from the user.
For the buffer space to use we will first call cmp_compl() to get the complement of cmp space as a span.
After read_line returns we will always set cmp.end to point to the end of the RETURNED span; this makes sure nothing else uses that space later.
NOTE: THIS MEANS THE VALUE THAT IS ****RETURNED**** BY THE READ_LINE FUNCTION.

Additional to the "normal" conf vars, we also have the files, and the language setting for each file.

First, it's a requirement that there be at least one file, even if it is empty, otherwise we have nowhere to put any blocks and no way to get things off the ground.
Therefore if there are no files on the state, we will prompt the user to name one file that can be added to the project.
Our prompt for this is "Enter at least one project file (e.g. main.c or main.py or index.js) where your blocks will be stored.".
We then create this as an empty file if it does not already exist by calling add_projfile() with the path.
Note that this function may fail, in which case it will return 0.
If it returns 0 (i.e. false), we loop until it returns positive, as there's no going forward without a place to store blocks.

Next, if there is a file in projfiles that doesn't have a language set, then we tell the user that this is required and set the language on the projfile in this case.
We tell them that the language must be one of our supported languages (see #langtable above), and determines how blocks start and also where the comment part ends and code part starts.
Our prompt for this is "Please specify a language for <file>, one of <list of languages>.", where the file is the path and the list of languages is from #langtable.

Once we have set all the required conf vars, if any of them were missing, including any languages on the projfiles, or adding the first projfile, then we call save_conf() which just rewrites the conf file.
To handle all of this we declare some int indicator(s) at the top of the function, set to 0 initially and use this to call save_conf() only if we changed some conf var.

/* handle_edited_file

Here we are given a tmp file containing new contents of a block.

Every block belongs to a projfile, and the blocks are in order of the projfiles (set up in the conf file).

What we must do is replace the existing block contents with the new contents of that tmp file, and then write everything out to a new file on disk called a rev for the particular projfile that contains that block.

We already have on state all the current values of the blocks, which are spans that point into inp.
First we want to fix inp to reflect the new reality, and then we will write out the new disk file from inp (our global input span).
We will also fix the contents spans of all of the files starting with this one, and including all later ones.

We get the span corresponding to the current block, which is also the edited block, in a local variable for convenience.
We can do the same for the .contents of the file, calling file_for_block to get the index.

The contents of inp are already correct, up to the start of this block, which is what we want to replace.
Now we get the size of the tmp file and compare it to the len of the existing block (recall that len(span) exists and is one of our most commonly used library methods).
If it is larger, we need to move the contents after it (in inp) to the right in memory, if smaller, to the left.
We can do this using memmove.

Once we have done this, we have everything correct in inp except for the contents of the file itself, and we have a space that's sufficient for the file contents to be read into.
We construct a span that represents this space.
This span starts at the .buf of the original block, but has the length of the file.

We have a library function, span read_file_into_span(char*,span), which takes a span and reads a file into a prefix of that span, and then returns that prefix as another span.
We can pass our "gap" span representing the part of inp that we want to replace to this function, along with the filename.
We can confirm that the span that is returned is in fact the identical span as the buffer we passed in, since we are expecting that the file length has not changed.

As usual, if this expectation is violated we will complain and exit (using our exit_with_error(char*) convenience function).

Now inp is representing the new state of the project.

However, the file[i].contents for the files including and subsequent to this one may be incorrect.
Specifically, the difference in length of this block must be added to the .end of the file contents span for this file, and to both the .buf and .end of every subsequent file.

As a sanity check, after this step, we could validate that the .end of the last file is equal to the .end of inp itself.

We need to update the blocks, since any blocks after and including this one may have moved, so we call find_all_blocks().

Then we call a helper function, new_rev, which takes the filename and the file index for the projfile that was altered.
This function is responsible for storing a new rev, cleaning up the tmp file, and any reporting to the user that we might do.

We then write the contents of the projfile into this file (the "rev") using write_to_file().
The projfile.contents (which is on state->files) already contains the current contents that we want to write out.

Once this is all done, we call update_projfile, which handles the rest of the process, using the index, tmp path, and rev path.

We get the index of an updated projfile, a tmp filename containing the new version of that file, which has already been processed, and is only passed in so that we can unlink it when all is successfully completed, and a rev path which contains the new version of that file.

From state->files we get the path of the projfile (state->files.a[file_index].path).
Our task is to replace that file with a copy of the new rev, after a few checks.

The file already there may have been edited and contain unsaved changes by some other process.
Therefore, if there is a file already there (at the projfile location), we rename it, adding ".bak".

We get the permissions of the projfile from the filesystem, as we will want to preserve them (for example, an exec bit may be set).

Then we copy the new rev into the projfile location.

We set the permissions to be equal to whatever we got from the original file.

Finally we unlink the tmp filename that was passed in, since we have now fully processed it.
The tmp filename is actually optional, since we sometimes also are processing clipboard input, so if it is empty we skip this step.

As usual, if any of these steps goes wrong, we prt, flush, and exit(1).

To split out the block_comment_part of a span, we first write two helper functions, one for C and one for Python.
Others will be added but these are the only ones we've needed so far.

Then we dispatch based on the language on the projfile which we lookup using file_for_block(), and .language on the file in the state.
Previously, if this span contained "Python" we called the Python version, and otherwise we called the C version (which was therefore our default).
Now, however, we look up the language in the #langtable above and call the find block comment end implementation.
For example, the third language we support is JS, which uses the same implementation as C.

The helper function always takes a span and returns an index offset to the location of the "block comment part terminator".
For Python this is the second occurrence of the triple doublequote in the block, and for C it is star slash.

In the main function block_comment_part, we return the span up to and including the comment part terminator, and also including any newlines and whitespace after it.
This means each of the helper functions returns the offset at which the comment terminator ends, and the main function includes a while isspace loop to advance past any whitespace.
(Among other things, this ensures that "R" does not unduly change the amount of whitespace mid-block.)

All three functions are written below.

In comment_to_prompt, we use the cmp space to construct a prompt around the given block comment.

First we should create our return span and assign .buf to the cmp.end location.

Then we call prt2cmp.

Next we prt a literal string (such as "```c\n").
Then we use wrs to write the span passed in as our argument.
Finally we write "```\n\n" and an instruction.

The above three elements are given in #langtable above as 6., block comment part to prompt pattern.

Next we call prt2std to go back to the normal output mode.

Then we can get the new end of cmp and make that the end of our return span so that we return everything written into the cmp space.

There is a global ui_state* variable "state" with a span cbcopy on it.

We run this as a command and pass the span data to its stdin.
We use the `s_buffer()` library method and heap buffer pattern to get a null-terminated string for popen from our span conf var.

We complain and exit if anything goes wrong as per usual.

/* #compile()

In compile(), we take the state and execute buildcmd, which is a config parameter.

First we call ensure_conf_var(state->buildcmd), since we are about to use that setting.

Next we print the command that we are going to run and flush, so the user sees something before the compiler process, which may be slow to produce output.

Then we use system(3) on a 2048-char buf which we allocate and statically zero.
Our s_buffer() interface (s_buffer(char*,int,span)) lets us set buildcmd as a null-terminated string beginning at buf.

We wait for another keystroke before returning if the compiler process fails, so the user can read the compiler errors (later we'll handle them better).
(Remember to call flush() before getch() so the user sees the prompt (which is "Build failed, press any key to continue...").)

On the other hand, if the build succeeds, we don't need the extra keystroke and go back to the main loop after a 1s delay so the user has time to read the success message before the main loop refreshes the current block.
In this case we prt "Build succeeded" on a line.

(We aren't doing this yet, but later we'll put something on the state to provide more status info to the user.)

We get a command (as a span) and we run it, sending the output into the complement of cmp in cmp_space.

We use the cmp buffer to store this data, starting from cmp.end (which is always somewhere before the end of the cmp space big buffer).

The space that we can use is the difference between cmp_space + BUF_SZ, which locates the end of the cmp_space, and cmp.end, which is always less than this limit.

We then create a span, which is pointing into cmp, capturing the new data we just captured, which is our return value.

/* #replace_block_code_part(span)

Here we get a span (into cmp space) which contains a new code part for the current block.

Note: To get the length of a span, use len().
Note: Do this every time, not the just the first time.

Similar to handle_edited_file() above, we are given a span (instead of a file) and we must update the current block, moving data around in memory as necessary.

We put the original block's span in a local variable for convenience.

The end result of inp should contain:
- the contents of inp currently, up to the start (the .buf) of the original block.
- the comment part of the current block, which we can get from block_comment_part on the current block.
- up to two newlines unless the block comment part already ends with them
- the code part coming from the clipboard in our second argument
- one newline after the code part and before the next block
- current contents of inp from the .end of the original block to the inp.end of original input.

We check whether we are adding zero, one, or two newlines between the comment part and the new code part.
If the comment part is empty or is less than len 2, we don't do the check and don't add any newlines.
We get the index of the projfile from file_for_block.
Then we check the length of what the new block will be (comment part + opt. newlines + new part + newline).
We then compare this to the old block length and do a memmove if necessary on the "rest" of inp, so that we have a gap to accommodate the new block's len.
Then we simply copy any newlines and the new code into inp.
(We do not need to copy the comment part, as it is already there in the original block.)

We then must update the .end of the current file contents, and both the .buf and .end of all subsequent projfiles, since the block length may have changed and therefore the file contents lengths will have also changed.

As before we then find the current locations of the blocks.

Once all this is done, we call new_rev, passing a null span for the filename, since there's no filename here.
